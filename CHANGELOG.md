# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.

## 1.5.1

**Release date:** 2025-02-25

This patch release fixes a bug introduced in v1.5.0
that was causing spurious logging for deprecated API versions
and sometimes failures on health checks.

In addition, all error logs resulting from SOPS decryption
failures have been sanitised.

Fixes:
- Fix secret value showing up in logs
  [#1372](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1372)
- Use lazy restmapper vendored from controller-runtime v0.19
  [#1377](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1377)

## 1.5.0

**Release date:** 2025-02-18

This minor release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.

The controller has been updated to Kustomize **v5.6**, please see the
`kubernetes-sigs/kustomize` [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases)
for more details.

The Kustomization API now supports custom health checks for Custom
Resources through Common Expression Language (CEL) expressions.
See [docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomizations/#health-check-expressions).

The controller now sends an origin revision from OCI artifact
annotations to notification-controller on events, which is
useful for updating commit statuses on the notification
providers that support this feature.
See [docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/cheatsheets/oci-artifacts/#git-commit-status-updates).

It is now also possible to control whether or not kustomize-controller
will orphan resources when a Kustomization is deleted.
See [docs](https://fluxcd.io/flux/components/kustomize/kustomizations/#deletion-policy).

In addition, the Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.32.1 and
various other controller dependencies have been updated to their latest
version.

## 1.4.0

**Release date:** 2024-09-27

This minor release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.

kustomize-controller in [sharded
deployment](https://fluxcd.io/flux/installation/configuration/sharding/)
configuration now supports cross-shard dependency check. This allows a
Kustomization to depend on other Kustomizations managed by different controller
shards.

In addition, the Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.31.1 and
various other controller dependencies have been updated to their latest version.
The controller is now built with Go 1.23.

Fixes:
- Fix incorrect use of format strings with the conditions package.
  [#1198](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1198)

Improvements:
- Update Bucket API to v1
  [#1253](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1253)

## 1.3.0

**Release date:** 2024-05-06

This minor release comes with new features, improvements and bug fixes.

The controller has been updated to Kustomize **v5.4**, please see the
`kubernetes-sigs/kustomize` [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases)
for more details.

The Flux `Kustomization` API gains two optional fields `.spec.namePrefix` and `.spec.nameSuffix`
that can be used to specify a prefix and suffix to be added to the names
of all managed resources.

The controller now supports the `--feature-gates=StrictPostBuildSubstitutions=true`
flag, when enabled the post-build substitutions will fail if a
variable without a default value is declared in files but is
missing from the input vars.

When using variable substitution with values that are numbers or booleans,
it is now possible to covert the values to strings, for more details see the 
[post-build documentation](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/blob/release/v1.3.x/docs/spec/v1/kustomizations.md#post-build-substitution-of-numbers-and-booleans).

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated to Kubernetes v1.30
and controller-runtime v0.18. Various other dependencies have also been updated to
their latest version to patch upstream CVEs.

Lastly, the controller is now built with Go 1.22.

Improvements:
- Implement name prefix/suffix transformers
  [#1134](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1134)
- Add `StrictPostBuildSubstitutions` feature flag
  [#1130](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1130)

  [#1139](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1139)
  [#1122](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1122)

Fixes:
- Fix requeue warning introduced by controller-runtime
  [#1090](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1090)
- Remove effectless statement
  [#1091](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1091)
- Remove `genclient:Namespaced` tag
  [#1092](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1092)

## 1.2.2

**Release date:** 2024-02-01

This patch release comes with various bug fixes and improvements.

Reconciling empty directories and directories without Kubernetes manifests no
longer results in an error. This regressing bug was introduced with the
controller upgrade to Kustomize v5.3 and has been fixed in this patch release.

The regression due to which the namespaced objects without a namespace specified
resulted in `not found` error instead of `namespace not specified` has also been
fixed. And the regression due to which Roles and ClusterRoles were reconciled
over and over due to the normalization of Roles and ClusterRoles has also been
fixed.

In addition, the Kubernetes dependencies have been updated to v1.28.6. Various
other dependencies have also been updated to their latest version to patch
upstream CVEs.

Lastly, the controller is now built with Go 1.21.

Improvements:
- Update Go to 1.21
  [#1053](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1053)
- Various dependency updates

## 1.2.1

**Release date:** 2023-12-14

This patch release comes with improvements in logging to provide faster feedback
on any HTTP errors encountered while fetching source artifacts.

In addition, the status condition messages are now trimmed to respect the size
limit defined by the API.

Improvements:
- Update runtime to v0.43.3
  [#1031](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1031)
- Log HTTP errors to provide faster feedback
  [#1028](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1028)

## 1.2.0

**Release date:** 2023-12-11

This minor release comes with performance improvements, bug fixes and several new features.

The controller has been updated from Kustomize v5.0 to **v5.3**, please the see
`kubernetes-sigs/kustomize` [changelog](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases)
for a more details.

Starting with this version, the controller will automatically perform a cleanup of
the Pods belonging to stale Kubernetes Jobs after a force apply.

A new controller flag `--override-manager` has been added to extend the Field Managers disallow list.
Using this flag, cluster administrators can configure the controller to undo changes
made with Lens and other UI tools that directly modify Kubernetes objects on clusters.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated, including an update to Kubernetes v1.28.
The container base image has been updated to Alpine 3.19.

Improvements:
- Update source-controller to v1.2.2
  [#1024](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/1024)

  [#995](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/995)

## 1.1.1

**Release date:** 2023-10-11

This patch release contains an improvement to retry the reconciliation of a
`Kustomization` as soon as the source artifact is available in storage.
Which is particularly useful when the source-controller has just been upgraded.

In addition, the controller can now detect immutable field errors returned by the
Google Cloud k8s-config-connector admission controller and recreate the GCP custom
resources annotated with `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force: Enabled`.

Improvements:
- Update `fluxcd/pkg` dependencies
  [#983](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/983)

  [#978](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/978)

## 1.1.0

**Release date:** 2023-08-23

This minor release comes with performance improvements, bug fixes and several new features.

The apply behaviour has been extended with two policies `IfNotPresent` and `Ignore`.
To change the apply behaviour for specific Kubernetes resources, you can annotate them with:

| Annotation                          | Default    | Values                                                         | Role            |
|-------------------------------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|
| `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/ssa`   | `Override` | - `Override`<br/>- `Merge`<br/>- `IfNotPresent`<br/>- `Ignore` | Apply policy    |
| `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force` | `Disabled` | - `Enabled`<br/>- `Disabled`                                   | Recreate policy |
| `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/prune` | `Enabled`  | - `Enabled`<br/>- `Disabled`                                   | Delete policy   |

The `IfNotPresent` policy instructs the controller to only apply the Kubernetes resources if they are not present on the cluster.
This policy can be used for Kubernetes `Secrets` and `ValidatingWebhookConfigurations` managed by cert-manager,
where Flux creates the resources with fields that are later on mutated by other controllers.

This version improves the health checking with fail-fast behaviour
by detecting stalled Kubernetes rollouts.

In addition, the controller now stops exporting an object's
metrics as soon as the object has been deleted.

Lastly, this release introduces two controller flags:

- The `--concurrent-ssa` flag sets the number of concurrent server-side apply operations
  performed by the controller. Defaults to 4 concurrent operations per reconciliation.
- The `--interval-jitter-percentage` flag makes the
  controller distribute the load more evenly when multiple objects are set up
  with the same interval. The default of this flag is set to `5`, which means
  that the interval will be jittered by a +/- 5% random value (e.g. if the
  interval is 10 minutes, the actual reconciliation interval will be between 9.5
  and 10.5 minutes).

Improvements:
- Add `--concurrent-ssa` flag
  [#948](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/948)
- Add `IfNotPresent` and `Ignore` SSA policies
  [#943](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/943)
- controller: jitter requeue interval
  [#940](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/940)
- Enable fail-fast behavior for health checks
  [#933](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/933)
- Bump `fluxcd/pkg/ssa` to improve immutable error detection
  [#932](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/932)
- Update dependencies
  [#939](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/939)
- Update Source API to v1.1.0
  [#952](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/952)

Fixes:
- Handle delete before adding finalizer
  [#930](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/930)
- Delete stale metrics on object delete
  [#944](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/944)

## 1.0.0-rc.1

**Release date:** 2023-04-03

This release candidate promotes the `Kustomization` API from `v1beta2` to `v1`.
The controller now supports horizontal scaling using
sharding based on a label selector.

In addition, the controller now supports Workload Identity when
decrypting secrets with SOPS and Azure Vault.

### Highlights

This release candidate requires the `GitRepository` API version `v1`,
first shipped with [source-controller](https://github.com/fluxcd/source-controller)
v1.0.0-rc.1.

#### API changes

The `Kustomization` kind was promoted from v1beta2 to v1 (GA) and deprecated fields were removed.

A new optional field called `CommonMetadata` was added to the API
for setting labels and/or annotations to all resources part of a Kustomization.
The main difference to the Kustomize
[commonLabels](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/commonlabels/) and
[commonAnnotations](https://kubectl.docs.kubernetes.io/references/kustomize/kustomization/commonannotations/),
is that the controller sets the labels and annotations only to the top level `metadata` field,
without patching the Kubernetes Deployment `spec.template` or the Service `spec.selector`.

The `kustomizations.kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io` CRD contains the following versions:
- v1 (storage version)
- v1beta2 (deprecated)
- v1beta1 (deprecated)

#### Upgrade procedure

The `Kustomization` v1 API is backwards compatible with v1beta2, except for the following:
- the deprecated field `.spec.validation` was removed
- the deprecated field `.spec.patchesStrategicMerge` was removed (replaced by `.spec.patches`)
- the deprecated field `.spec.patchesJson6902 ` was removed (replaced by `.spec.patches`)

To upgrade from v1beta2, after deploying the new CRD and controller,
set  `apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1` in the YAML files that contain
`Kustomization` definitions and remove the deprecated fields if any.
Bumping the API version in manifests can be done gradually.
It is advised to not delay this procedure as the beta versions will be removed after 6 months.

#### Sharding

Starting with this release, the controller can be configured with
`--watch-label-selector`, after which only objects with this label will
be reconciled by the controller.

This allows for horizontal scaling, where kustomize-controller
can be deployed multiple times with a unique label selector
which is used as the sharding key.

**Release date:** 2023-03-08

This prerelease adds support for disabling the cache of the `kstatus` status
poller, which is used to determine the health of the resources applied by the
controller. To disable the cache, configure the Deployment of the controller
with `--feature-gates=DisableStatusPollerCache=true`.

This may have a positive impact on memory usage on large clusters with many
objects, at the cost of an increased number of API calls.

In addition, `klog` has been configured to log using the same logger as the
rest of the controller (providing a consistent log format).

Lastly, the controller is now built using Go `1.20`, and the dependencies have
been updated to their latest versions.

Improvements:
- api: update description LastAppliedRevision
  [#798](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/798)
- Update Go to 1.20
  [#806](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/806)

[RFC-0005](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/tree/main/rfcs/0005-artifact-revision-and-digest)
revision format produced by source-controller `>=v0.35.0`.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated to their latest
versions.

Improvements:
- Support RFC-0005 revision format
  [#793](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/793)
- Update dependencies
  [#796](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/796)

## 0.33.0

**Release date:** 2023-02-01

This prerelease comes with support for recreating immutable resources (e.g. Kubernetes Jobs)
by annotating or labeling them with `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/force: enabled`.

The caching of Secret and ConfigMap resources has been disabled to improve memory usage.
To opt-out from this behavior, start the controller with: `--feature-gates=CacheSecretsAndConfigMaps=true`.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated to
Kubernetes v1.26.1 and controller-runtime v0.14.2. The controller base image has 
been updated to Alpine 3.17 (which contains CVE fixes for OS packages).

## 0.31.0

**Release date:** 2022-11-18

This prerelease comes with improvements to the manifests
generation component. The Kustomize overlay build logic has been
factored out into `github.com/fluxcd/pkg/kustomize` so that both
the controller and the Flux CLI (`flux buid kustomization`)
share the same code base.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated to
Kubernetes v1.25.4 and controller-runtime v0.13.1.
The Azure Vault SDK used for secrets decryption has been updated

  [#761](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/761)

## 0.30.0

**Release date:** 2022-10-21

This prerelease comes with new status condition named `Reconciling` which improves
the observability for the actions performed by the controller during a reconciliation run.
The `Kustomization.status.conditions` have been aligned with Kubernetes
standard conditions and kstatus.

In addition, the controller memory usage was reduced by 90% when performing artifact
operations and can now better handle the reconciliation of large sources in-parallel.

Improvements:
- Optimise the memory usage of artifact operations
  [#747](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/747)
- Refactor: Adopt Flux runtime conditions and status standards

  [#749](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/749)
- Update dependencies
  [#750](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/750)

## 0.29.0

**Release date:** 2022-09-29

This prerelease comes with strict validation rules for API fields which define a
(time) duration. Effectively, this means values without a time unit (e.g. `ms`,
`s`, `m`, `h`) will now be rejected by the API server. To stimulate sane
configurations, the units `ns`, `us` and `µs` can no longer be configured, nor
can `h` be set for fields defining a timeout value.

In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated
to Kubernetes controller-runtime v0.13.

:warning: **Breaking changes:**
- `.spec.interval` new validation pattern is `"^([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?(ms|s|m|h))+$"`
- `.spec.retryInterval` new validation pattern is `"^([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?(ms|s|m|h))+$"`
- `.spec.timeout` new validation pattern is `"^([0-9]+(\\.[0-9]+)?(ms|s|m))+$"`

- Fix health checking for global objects
  [#730](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/730)

## 0.28.0

**Release date:** 2022-09-12

This prerelease comes with improvements to reconciling Kubernetes class type objects,
SOPS decryption and fuzzing. In addition, the controller dependencies have been updated
to Kubernetes controller-runtime v0.12.

:warning: **Breaking change:** The controller logs have been aligned
with the Kubernetes structured logging. For more details on the new logging
structure please see: [fluxcd/flux2#3051](https://github.com/fluxcd/flux2/issues/3051).

Improvements:
- Align controller logs to Kubernetes structured logging
  [#718](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/718)
- Reconcile Kubernetes class type objects in a dedicated stage
  [#720](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/720)

  [#677](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/677)

## 0.26.0

**Release date:** 2022-06-01

This prerelease comes with support for configuring the authentication to
AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault and GCP KMS on multi-tenant clusters.
A tenant can create a secret in their namespace with their KMS credentials
and supply it to Flux using `Kustomization.spec.decryption.secretRef`.
For more details on how to configure SOPS decryption with KMS, see the
[docs](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/blob/v0.26.0/docs/spec/v1beta2/kustomization.md#secrets-decryption).

Starting with this version, the controller conforms to the Kubernetes
[API Priority and Fairness](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/flow-control/).
The controller detects if the server-side throttling is enabled and uses the
advertised rate limits. When server-side throttling is enabled, the controller
ignores the `--kube-api-qps` and `--kube-api-burst` flags.

In addition, Kustomize has been updated
to [`v4.5.5`](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv4.5.5) 
which comes with significant performance improvements for OpenAPI parsing.

Improvements:
- Support AWS KMS credentials using decryption secretRef
  [#641](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/641)
  [#667](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/667)

  [#671](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/671)

Fixes:
- Set digests in image override
  [#655](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/655)

## 0.25.0

**Release date:** 2022-05-03

This prerelease adds support for disallowing remote bases in Kustomize overlays
using `--no-remote-bases=true` (default: `false`).  When this flag is enabled on
the controller, all resources must refer to local files included in the Source
Artifact, meaning only the Flux Sources can affect the cluster-state. Users
are encouraged to enable it on production systems for security and performance
reasons.

In addition, support has been introduced for defining a KubeConfig Secret data
key in the `.spec.kubeConfig.SecretRef.key` (default: `value` or `value.yaml`),
and dependencies have been updated.

Improvements:
- Support defining a KubeConfig Secret data key
  [#615](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/615)
  [#645](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/645)

- decryptor: improve detection of in and out formats for Secret data fields
  [#644](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/644)

## 0.24.4

**Release date:** 2022-04-28

This prerelease ensures we recover from Kustomize build panics to guarantee
continuity of operations when running into invalid object data.

In addition, handling of file formats while decrypting Secret generator entries
with SOPS has been improved to ensure encrypted files in format A can be
decrypted to target format B.

Fixes:
- Use Secret generator keys for SOPS format hint
  [#636](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/636)

Improvements:
- generator: recover from kustomize build panics
  [#637](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/637)

## 0.24.3

**Release date:** 2022-04-22

This prerelease allows for configuring the exponential back-off retry, already
introduced in other Flux controllers. It can be configured with the new flags:
`--min-retry-delay` (default: `750ms`) and `--max-retry-delay`
(default: `15min`). Previously the defaults were set to `5ms` and `1000s`.

Fixes:
- Ensure generated temp dir is absolute on all OSes
  [#630](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/630)

Improvements:
- feat: flags to configure exponential backoff retry
  [#631](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/631)

please static security analysers (CVE-2022-27191).

Fixes:
- Update golang.org/x/crypto
  [#628](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/628)

## 0.24.1

**Release date:** 2022-04-20

This prerelease fixes a regression bug introduced in
[#620](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/620), which
prevented remote build directories from being reachable within the FS.

Fixes:
- generator: ensure remote build dirs can be reached
  [#626](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/626)

## 0.24.0

**Release date:** 2022-04-19

This prerelease matures the Kustomize decryptor service, which handles the
actual decryption of SOPS' encrypted Secrets, and now allows decrypting
[file sources](https://pkg.go.dev/sigs.k8s.io/kustomize@v1.0.2/pkg/types#DataSources)
referenced in Kustomization files.

In addition, Kustomize now operates using our own file system implementation,
and dependencies have been updated to their latest versions.

Improvements:
- controllers: improve decryptor and add tests
  [#619](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/619)

## 0.23.0

**Release date:** 2022-04-05

This prerelease adds some breaking changes around the use and handling of kubeconfigs 
files for remote reconciliations. Implements health checks for kubernetes jobs and 
updates documentation.

SOPS implementation was refactored to include various improvements and extended code
coverage. Age identities are now imported once and reused multiple times, optimising
CPU and memory usage between decryption operations.

**Breaking changes**:

- Use of file-based KubeConfig options are now permanently disabled (e.g. 
`TLSClientConfig.CAFile`, `TLSClientConfig.KeyFile`, `TLSClientConfig.CertFile`
and `BearerTokenFile`). The drive behind the change was to discourage
insecure practices of mounting Kubernetes tokens inside the controller's container file system.
- Use of `TLSClientConfig.Insecure` in KubeConfig file is disabled by default,
but can enabled at controller level with the flag `--insecure-kubeconfig-tls`.
- Use of `ExecProvider` in KubeConfig file is now disabled by default,
but can enabled at controller level with the flag `--insecure-kubeconfig-exec`.

Improvements:
- Add kubeconfig flags
  [#593](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/593)
- sops: various improvements and tests
  [#607](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/607)

reconciliation run.

Fixes:
- Ensure event annotations are prefixed with Group FQDN
  [#591](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/591)

## 0.22.0

**Release date:** 2022-03-21

This prerelease introduces a new annotation `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/ssa: merge`
for allowing kustomize-controller to patch cluster addons such as CoreDNS without removing
the kubectl managed fields.

The source-controller dependency was updated to version `v0.22` which 
introduces API `v1beta2` and deprecates `v1beta1`.

In addition, various dependencies where updated to their latest versions, and
the code base was refactored to align with `fluxcd/pkg/runtime` v0.13 release.

Improvements:

**Release date:** 2022-02-16

This prerelease comes with support for making the Kubernetes Secrets and ConfigMaps
referenced in `postBuild.substituteFrom` optional.
When `substituteFrom.optional` is set to `true`, the controller will ignore
not found errors, and will substitute the variables with their default values.

Features:
- Tolerate absence of resources in post-build substitution
  [#570](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/570)

## 0.20.2

**Release date:** 2022-02-10

## 0.20.1

**Release date:** 2022-02-07

This prerelease comes with an update to the `sigs.k8s.io/kustomize` packages, bringing 
the controller on par with the Kustomize v4.5.1 release.

Improvements:
- Update controller to kustomize v4.5.1
  [#559](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/559)

Fixes:
* Transfer ownership of the kubectl managed fields
  [#562](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/562)

## 0.20.0

**Release date:** 2022-02-01

This prerelease comes with security improvements for multi-tenant clusters:
- Platform admins can enforce impersonation across the cluster using the `--default-service-account` flag.
  When the flag is set, all `Kustomizations`, which don't have `spec.serviceAccountName` specified,
  use the service account name provided by `--default-service-account=<SA Name>` in the namespace of the object.
- Platform admins can disable cross-namespace references with the `--no-cross-namespace-refs=true` flag.
  When this flag is set, `Kustomizations` can only refer to sources (`GitRepositories` and `Buckets`)
  in the same namespace as the `Kustomization` object, preventing tenants from accessing another tenant's repositories.

The controller container images are signed with
[Cosign and GitHub OIDC](https://github.com/sigstore/cosign/blob/22007e56aee419ae361c9f021869a30e9ae7be03/KEYLESS.md),
and a Software Bill of Materials in [SPDX format](https://spdx.dev) has been published on the release page.

Starting with this version, the controller deployment conforms to the
Kubernetes [restricted pod security standard](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/security/pod-security-standards/#restricted):
- all Linux capabilities were dropped
- the root filesystem was set to read-only
- the seccomp profile was set to the runtime default
- run as non-root was enabled
- the user and group ID was set to 65534

**Breaking changes**:
- The use of new seccomp API requires Kubernetes 1.19.
- The controller container is now executed under 65534:65534 (userid:groupid).
  This change may break deployments that hard-coded the user ID of 'controller' in their PodSecurityPolicy.
- When both `spec.kubeConfig` and `spec.ServiceAccountName` are specified, the controller will impersonate
  the service account on the target cluster, previously the controller ignored the service account.

Features:
- Allow setting a default service account for impersonation
  [#550](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/550)
- Allow disabling cross-namespace references
  [#549](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/549)

This prerelease comes with support for ignoring changes made to in-cluster resources
by annotating them with:

```yaml
kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/reconcile: disabled
```

When the `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/reconcile` annotation is set to `disabled`,
the controller will no longer apply changes from source, nor will it prune the resource.
To resume reconciliation, set the annotation to `enabled` or remove it.

Features:
* Allow disabling the reconciliation of in-cluster resources
  [#484](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/484)

## 0.15.0

**Release date:** 2021-10-08

This prerelease comes with a [new reconciler](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/426)
based on Kubernetes server-side apply and graduates the API to `v1beta2`.

The controller dependencies has been updated to match
kustomize [v4.4.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv4.4.0)
which restores the usage of YAML anchors.

**Breaking changes**

- Namespaced objects must contain `metadata.namespace`, defaulting to the `default` namespace is no longer supported.
  Setting a namespace for all objects reconciled by a Kustomization can be done with `spec.targetNamespace`.
- The logs, events and alerts that report Kubernetes namespaced object changes are
  now using the `Kind/Namespace/Name` format instead of `Kind/Name`.
- The minimum required version of Kubernetes has changed to:

    | Kubernetes version | Minimum required |
    | --- | --- |
    | `v1.16` | `>= 1.16.11` |
    | `v1.17` | `>= 1.17.7` |
    | `v1.18` | `>= 1.18.4` |
    | `v1.19` and later | `>= 1.19.0` |

**Features and Improvements**

- Being able to validate and reconcile sources that contain both CRDs and CRs.
- Being able to wait for all the applied resources to become ready
  without requiring users to fill-in the health check list.
- Improve performance (CPU, memory, network, FD usage) and reduce the number of calls to Kubernetes API
  by replacing kubectl execs with a specialized applier written in Go.
- Detect and report drift between the desired state (git, s3, etc) and cluster state reliably.
- Improve the overall observably of the reconciliation process by reporting in real-time
  the garbage collection and health assessment actions.
- Reconcile empty sources including pruning of all the resources previously applied.
- Mask secrets data in logs, events and alerts.

**API changes**

The `kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta2` API is backwards compatible with `v1beta1`.

Additions, deprecations and removals:
- `.spec.patchesStrategicMerge` deprecated in favour of `.spec.patches`
- `.spec.patchesJson6902` deprecated in favour of `.spec.patches`
- `.spec.validation` deprecated and no longer used (server-side validation is implicit)
- `.spec.wait` added (when enabled, will wait for all the reconciled resources to become ready)
- `.status.snapshot` replaced by `.status.inventory`

Updating the manifests in Git to `v1beta2` can be done at any time after the kustomize-controller upgrade.
All users are encouraged to update the manifests as the deprecated fields
will be removed when the next API version will be released.

## 0.14.1

**Release date:** 2021-09-09

This prerelease comes with improvements to logging.
When Kubernetes Secrets can't be reconciled due to validation errors,
the controller will mask the secret data from logs and events to prevent
disclosing sensitive information.

Improvements:

  [#420](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/420)

## 0.14.0

**Release date:** 2021-08-26

This prerelease comes with improvements to garbage collection.
When pruning is enabled, the controller will skip the deletion of objects with
[ownerReference.BlockOwnerDeletion=true](https://v1-18.docs.kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/garbage-collection/#controlling-how-the-garbage-collector-deletes-dependents),
as they are subject to Kubernetes GC.

The controller dependencies has been updated to match
kustomize [v4.3.0](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/releases/tag/kustomize%2Fv4.3.0).

Improvements:

## 0.13.0

**Release date:** 2021-06-14

This prerelease brings the controller on a par with **Kustomize v4**.
The Kubernetes and controller-runtime dependencies have been updated to match the Kubernetes 1.21 release.

The Kustomization API has been extended with support for generic in-line
[patches](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/blob/v0.13.0/docs/spec/v1beta1/kustomization.md##patches).

Starting with this version, the controller uses an annotation instead of a label
to keep track of removed manifests from source.
Please consult the [garbage collection docs](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/blob/v0.13.0/docs/spec/v1beta1/kustomization.md#garbage-collection)
for more details.

**Breaking changes**:
* Due to the removal of `hashicorp/go-getter` from Kustomize v4,
  the set of URLs accepted by Kustomize in the `resources` filed
  is reduced to only file system paths or values compatible with `git clone`.
  This means you can no longer use resources from archives (zip, tgz, etc).
* YAML anchors are no longer supported in Kustomize v4,
  see [kustomize/issues/3675](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/3675)
  for more details. 
* Due to a [bug](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/kustomize/issues/3446)
  in Kustomize v4, if you have **non-string keys** in your manifests,
  the controller will fail with `json: unsupported type` error.
 
Features:
* Add support for in-line generic patches to Flux Kustomization API
  [#364](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/364)

Improvements:

This prerelease adds an array field called `substituteFrom` to the post build
API. `SubstituteFrom` holds references to `ConfigMaps` and `Secrets` containing
the variables (data keys) and their values (data values) to be substituted in
the YAML manifests.

You can disable the variable substitution for certain resources by either
labeling or annotating them with:

```yaml
kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/substitute: disabled
``` 

Features:

[Strategic Merge and JSON 6902 patches](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/blob/v0.8.0/docs/spec/v1beta1/kustomization.md#override-kustomize-config).

Pruning can be disabled for certain resources by either
labeling or annotating them with:
```yaml
kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/prune: disabled
```

Golang `pprof` endpoints have been enabled on the metrics server,
making it easier to collect runtime information to debug performance issues.

Features:
* Add support for variable substitutions
  [#253](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/253)
* Support Strategic Merge and JSON 6902 patches
  [#264](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/264)
* Allow disabling of prune on certain resources
  [#267](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/267)

This prerelease comes with a change to the Kustomization
status so that the controller can keep track of the last health
assessment result and avoid issuing redundant health check events.

Improvements:
* Add Healthy status condition
  [#262](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/262)
  
## 0.7.3

**Release date:** 2021-02-01

when running health checks and garbage collection.

Fixes:
* Clear `config.BearerTokenFile` when setting `BearerToken`
  [#258](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/258)

## 0.7.1

**Release date:** 2021-01-25

This prerelease fixes a regression bug introduced in `v0.7.0` that caused
failed reconciliations to be immediately retried instead of being scheduled
at the specified interval.

Fixes:
* Fix reconciliation retry scheduler
  [#256](https://github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller/pull/256)

## 0.7.0

**Release date:** 2021-01-22

An optional field was added `spec.retryInterval` that allows users to
requeue a failed reconciliation at a different interval than `spec.Interval`.

The `LocalObjectReference` from the Kubernetes core has been replaced
with our own, making `Name` a required field. The impact of this should
be limited to direct API consumers only, as the field was already
required by controller logic.
